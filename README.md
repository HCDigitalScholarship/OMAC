# OMAC ontology
The repository contains an OWL ontology, called OMAC - Ontology for Analytic Claims in Music, for musical critical assessments.

Current research work aims at improving and testing OMAC against domain experts' knowledge and case studies. The data included in the owl file of the ontology are meant for testing purposes only. The Data folder show some examples based on OMAC.
